A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

# üì° VHDL Message Exchange System

Welcome to the **VHDL Message Exchange System** repository! This project simulates a structured communication system using VHDL, complete with parameterized constants, a controller module, and a testbench for validation. Ideal for use in digital systems and embedded applications, the system highlights modular and configurable VHDL design.

## üìÅ Repository Contents

- **`CONSTANTS.vhd`** - Holds parameterized values for easy configuration, making the system adaptable to different requirements.
- **`controller.vhd`** - Implements core logic for message transmission and control, ensuring reliable data flow within the system.
- **`messageExTB.vhd`** - A testbench that simulates and verifies the controller‚Äôs behavior in various scenarios, validating system performance.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Modular Structure**: Components are designed independently, allowing for modular testing and easy integration.
- **Parameterization**: Adjustable constants in `CONSTANTS.vhd` for flexible configurations.
- **Comprehensive Testbench**: Includes a detailed testbench file to validate each part of the system.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **VHDL Simulator**: Ensure you have a simulator like ModelSim, Vivado, or GHDL installed for compiling and running VHDL files.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vhdl-message-exchange.git
   cd vhdl-message-exchange
